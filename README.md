# Context:
The Water Crisis has been a massive problem on our planet and has negatively affected billions of lives. The Water Crisis is the shortage of safe fresh water in various countries leading people to use unsafe water, leaving them vulnerable to illnesses like typhoid, polio, and even death. This crisis is correlated with others like the Women's Crisis and the Children's Education Crisis. Women and children are usually expected in certain countries to walk long distances to find safe drinkable water for their families. As shown, the Water Crisis is immense but in 2025, is the Water Crisis still a problem?
# Data: 
The datasets I used for my project were the "Population using safely managed drinking-water services (%)" in Western Europe over the span of 2000-2022. The next dataset I used was the "Population using safely managed drinking-water services (%)" in the US and Japan in order to show if the trends noticed in Western Europe continue with two other countries on two other continents.
The last dataset I used was the "Mortality Rate from Unsafe WASH in 2019" specifically in Western Europe.  
# Thesis Statement:
Incorrect Thesis: The water crisis is an issue that has been largely solved globally in recent years. 
Correct Thesis: The Water Crisis is still an unsolved long term issue that directly affects individual's health and survival.
# Corrections and Strategies: :
The correction on my project was showing the audience how the Water Crisis is affecting those globally specifically developing countries with fewer resources to manage. When introducing countries like the US and Japan to be more diverse, I specifically chose wealthier countries to deceive my audience into thinking that the Water Crisis has been solved not just in Western Europe but globally.  
The strategies I used from SWD to achieve this project were doing the opposite of what SWD recommended. I first made sure to use bar charts instead of a line chart to show change over time to specifically confuse the audience as bar charts are harder to see change over time. Another strategy I used was making sure I was not intentional with color. As seen in the "Globally" tab, the bar charts are color-coded in a manner that adds clutter and busyness throughout the entire tab to distract the audience from the story being communicated.
# Stories:
The story that can be derived from this distorted dashboard is that the Water Crisis has been solved and the majority of people on Earth are not struggling to find safe drinkable water. This will lead users to potentially stop donating/volunteering to organizations that aid victims of this crisis.
